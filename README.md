# ANDB-Projects


### Repository Description 

<b>This Repository</b> contains six mini projects. </br> 
In order to obtain the android Nanodegree from Udacity. </br>
The experience is gradual from the first project as the simplest one to the last project as the complicated one. </br>
Every project covers a specific topic. </br>
It took me 8 months practising and the entertainment to complete the six. </br>
